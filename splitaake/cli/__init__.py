NOTE:  The layout of the cli subdirectory of this package draws heavily from
the "conda" package manager for the anaconda package distribution.  I have
followed the general code structure used for the CLI of the conda package
manager because it is excellent, and the structure of the code aligns well
with a complex CLI interface.
