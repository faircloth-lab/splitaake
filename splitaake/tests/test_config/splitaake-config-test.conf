[Multiprocessing]
# Here you can set whether you want to use multiprocessing
# (typically you do).  You can let the program automatically determine
# the optimum number of cores to use (max[cores] - 2) or you can set the
# number of cores manually, e.g. to `4`.  Regardless of what you do here
# the program will use n - 1 cores to process data and 1 core to enter
# data to the database.  Should you wish to change this behavior, you
# will need to edit the source.
#
# If you edit the source, remember that SQLITE (the database we're using)
# will not accept input from multiple processes/threads simultaneously.  Thus,
# you will likely have to create a new demuxi/db.py file for your respective
# database platform.
